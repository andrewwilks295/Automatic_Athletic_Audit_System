## How to use

### 1. Configure your environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment since some dependencies have to be installed. Run the following command to create a virtual environment at `./.venv`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, install the requirements.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the program
```bash
python main.py
```
